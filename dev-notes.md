# Basic Setup

```sh
opam switch create . 5.1.0
eval $(opam env)
opam install dune utop ocaml-lsp-server ocamlformat
opam install ocolor ppx_deriving
dune runtest --watch
```

# Design Choices

## Recursion

Recursion concerns itself with recursive _types_ and recursive _values_.
Recursive types are types that refer to themselves. For instance: `tree = Leaf of int | Node (list tree)`.
Recursive values are values that refer to themselves. For instance, the fibonacci function.

There are recursive values with non-recursive types. eg: the fibonacci function.
There are non-recursive values with recursive types. eg: `Leaf 42` of the above-defined type `tree`.

### Recursive Types

The code implements recursive types through iso-recursion. This means that:
- Constructing / Building an expression `expr` of a recursive type `t` requires wrapping it with a `fold` (`fold expr`).
- Destructing / Using an expression `expr` of recursive type `t` requires unwrapping it through `unfold` (`unfold expr`).

This is most common with inductive types (recursive variants). In that case, you will do something like `match unfold (fold (Foo 42)) with`

### Recursive Values

The code implements recursive values through a `rec` constructor.

Consider those two examples:
```ocaml
(* Example 1 *)
let factorial = rec self -> fun x ->
if x = 0 then 1
else x * (self (x - 1))

(* Example 2 *)
let lazy_infinite_list = rec self -> 1 :: (fun () -> self)
```

Whenever `rec self -> body` is encountered during evaluation, `body` is evaluated with `self` binding to `rec self -> body` in the context.

Then, whenever `rec self -> body` is encountered when fetching a variable from the environment, it is evaluated one more time.
